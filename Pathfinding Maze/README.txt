It can do everything expect avoidance. there was an attempt in my code.
Yellow sphere is the player
Orange boi wanders randomly and a* the player if hes close to them.
Pink Boi a* to random tiles.
auto makes new maze if theres no solution or player get touched.
Esc - quit
r - regenerate maze

I know they move weird.
